RubishGram

RubishGram is a web application which aims to fight climate breakdown by calculating each user's
emissions of carbon dioxide. Each user is able to set a specific monthly carbon budget and, also, 
to update it through "Settings". 
In "Check current budget", a message appears according to user's current carbon emissions.
There are 3 types of messages: 
    1. If the user has spent less than half of the budget, the message is encouraging
    2. If the user has spent more than half of the budget a warning appears 
    3. In case the user has spent all the available budget the application informs him with a "Fail" 
    message.
